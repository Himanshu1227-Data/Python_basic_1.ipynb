        "Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that has gained immense popularity. Here are some key features that contribute to its widespread adoption:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Easy to Learn**: Python has a smooth learning curve and straightforward syntax. Its use of indentation instead of curly braces enhances code readability, making it an ideal choice for beginners in schools, universities, and colleges.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Free and Open-Source**: Python is available under an open-source license, allowing free usage for both personal and commercial purposes. You can download it from the official Python website without any charges.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Large Standard Library**: Python's extensive standard library includes modules and packages like itertools, functools, and operator. These pre-built tools significantly reduce development time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Python supports OOP concepts, making it easy to create and work with classes, objects, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python runs on various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification, making it highly versatile.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Dynamic Typing and Binding**: Python's dynamic typing allows flexible variable assignments, and dynamic binding simplifies method calls and attribute access.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Strong Community Support**: Python has an active community that contributes to its growth, maintains libraries, and provides support through forums and documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks**: Python offers libraries and frameworks for web development (Django, Flask), scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy), data analysis (Pandas), and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Community-Driven Updates**: Python evolves through PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals), ensuring continuous improvement and adaptability"

        "   - **Examples**:\n",
        "     - **Lists**: You can add, remove, or modify elements within a list.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Immutable Objects**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation. Any operation that seems to modify them actually creates a new object with the updated value.\n",
        "   - **Examples**:\n",
        "     - **Strings**: Once created, a string's content remains fixed.\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",

        "       ```python\n",
        "       my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "       # my_tuple[1] = 10  # Raises an error\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "     - **Integers, Floats, Booleans**: Numeric types and boolean values are immutable.\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       my_int = 42\n",
        "       my_float = 3.14\n",
        "       my_bool = True\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Why It Matters**:\n",
        "   - **Performance**: Immutable objects are faster to access because they don't change.\n",
        "   - **Safety**: Immutable objects prevent accidental modifications.\n",
        "   - **Hashability**: Immutable objects can be used as dictionary keys or elements in sets.\n",

        "1. **`if` Statement**:\n",
        "   - The simplest form of conditional statement.\n",
        "   - Syntax:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if condition:\n",
        "         # Statements to execute if condition is true\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "In Python, loops allow you to repeat a block of code based on certain conditions. There are two main types of loops: **`for`** loops and **`while`** loops. Let's explore each type along with examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`for` Loops**:\n",
        "   - **Syntax**: A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each element.\n",
        "   - **Use Cases**:\n",
        "     - Iterating through a list of items.\n",
        "     - Processing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "     - Generating a sequence of numbers using the `range()` function.\n",
        "   - **Example** (Iterating through a list):\n",

        "     fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`while` Loops**:\n",
        "   - **Syntax**: A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a condition remains true.\n",
        "   - **Use Cases**:\n",
        "     - Executing code until a specific condition is met.\n",
        "     - Implementing game loops or simulations.\n",
        "   - **Example** (Printing numbers from 1 to 5):\n",

        "     i = 1\n",
        "     while i <= 5:\n",

        "     ```\n",

        "3. **Infinite Loops**:\n",
        "   - Sometimes, loops can run indefinitely. This happens when:\n",
        "     - We forget to increment the loop variable (e.g., `i`) inside the loop.\n",
        "     - We provide a condition that is always true.\n",
        "   - **Example** (Infinite loop):\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`else` Statements with Loops**:\n",
        "   - The `else` block can be used with both `for` and `while` loops.\n",
        "   - It executes when the loop condition becomes false.\n",
        "   - **Example** (Using `else` with a `while` loop):\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     num = 5\n",
        "     while num > 0:\n",
